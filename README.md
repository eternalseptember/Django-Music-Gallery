Tutoral: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK


## Changes
1. The tutorial says to not mess with the manage.py file. I decided to in order to get this project to run in another port.
2. The video tutorial ends with:
  * non-functional "Add New Song" button on the details view
  * non-functional "Favorite" buttons
  * non-functional "Search" menu option
  * non-functional "Songs" menu option
  * non-functional "Logout" menu option
  * questionable view for people who have not logged in
So I created a new branch called "function-based-views" to adapt the code based on this link: https://github.com/buckyroberts/Viberr/
